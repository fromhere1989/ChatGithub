Hellow, here I'm learning how to work with express-session.

Next steps:
- How to render variables from server to client; -- done
- How to get variables from dataBase;
- Add session logic for login user;
- Add CRUD logic;
- Add chat logic with socket.io;
- Add save logic for chatrooms(saving massage history for login user);
